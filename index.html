        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p id="whatitis">Pure plain is a mathimatical theori about how dimentions, numbers and manny fysical properties work. It is in a understading about that there may is an additional dimestion within every one. These dimentions are made out of a "mode" called 'Plain'</p>
        <p>To understand simply think about a piece of papper, on one side there is a 2d grid. But there is also a backside to the papper. Pure plain then states that there is a simular 2d grid with some changes. If you then would pull that papper apart so that no sides where touching but still connected, you would have a 'Pure plain' of that papper.</p>

        </div>
        <p id="values">As you se in the image above if we do this in a 1d grid we get four diffirent axises. These gets divied into 'x', 'negative x', 'negative plained x' and 'negative plained negative x' [x, -x, P-(x), P-(-x)]</p>
        <p>This may not explain anything, so in the next chapter we will explain the theoretical proof</p>

        <h3>Theoretical Proof</h3>
        <p>To explain what, how and why about the theory we need to question another question. What is negetive time? I dont mean in any complex way, just what would happen if you would be in negative time. For most this is thier idéa:</p>
        <div class="center">
            <img alt="'Back to the future' movie." src="back-to-the-future.png">
        </div>
        <p>'Back to the future' has a some what simple idéa, simply to go back in time, Or in other words 'reversing time'. So lets try this idéa with an experiment.</p>
        <p>Lets say we are watching a movie (f.ex. 'Back to the future'). We decied to also then make a copy of the movie to be the negative time version, or to say we play everything in reverse. Bellow you se two identical gifs that then one has been revered in its order.</p>
        <div id="timewithnegative">
        <div class="spaceeven">
        <h4 class="mainText smallersize">Normal timed</h4>
        <h4 class="mainText smallersize">Theoretical negatived timed</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="spaceeven">
        <img class="smallersize" alt="moon.gif" src="moon.gif">
        <img class="smallersize" alt="moon.gif but reversed" src="P-(moon).gif">
        </div>
        </div>
        <p>This is fine right? No problem? There is a small problem. And that small problem makes a very big problems. But what is the problem? Well if we start playing both at the same time they will be always identical in the middle of the movies.</p>
        <div class="center">
        <img alt="Explination of the problem of time" src="Movie time.png">
        </div>
        <p>As seen above if b and e are equal that means that the center points are equal to eachone and another. But if thats true means that the positive center is the same as the negative center.</p>
        <p>But we didnt decide how long the movie is, and the movie can have any length. This will change the movies center. With that the center can be any thing. We therefore can say that in time, point 'a' will be equal to its negative point (aka '-a').</p>
        <p>But there is a problem this makes. Due to time is a part of geometry (that is the reason why a timeLINE is a line), that means this also works for a distance. So therefore can say that in a distance, point 'a' will be equal to its negative point (aka '-a').</p>
        <p>But even that maks a new problem. Due to geometry is based on numbers, that means this will also works for numbers. so there fore we can say that in numbers, point 'a' will be equal to its negative point (aka '-a').</p>
        <p>But that means that a=-a, or in other words</p>
        <div class="center">
        <h2 class="mainText"> 1 = -1</h2>
        </div>
        <p>This is very problematic if it wasent obivius. But what if, instead of being negative, it it still posative... but in another concept... or in another Plain? And that is what a negative plain is.</p>
        <p>But what then even is negative time?!? Well througth testing I came up with that it is 'The inverse law of geometric structure'. Or to say in other words you flip the negative and posative cordinates through origo (aka the point of 0,0)</p>
        <div class="center">
        <img alt="The inverse law of geometric structure" src="ILOGS.png">
        </div>
        <p>So that is what happens in negative time. Negative plain negative time is just both consepts at the same time. And presto! We have Pure Plain of time, and due to the same reasons as before this also works for numbers.</p>
        <p>So this is what we have right now:</p>
        <div class="center">
        <img alt="Pure plain of 1D" src="PPs.png">
        </div>
    </div>
    <div id="exsampleplace">
    <p>Bellow you can se an example of how it looks with changeing time. In it there is a box going from one side to the other. If it hits one side it bounces of it and travels in the same speed in the other direction. Then you have four buttons bellow, it will change what time we have in one of the examples. Then you can move the slider (named X-Value) bellow that and then press the 'Restart' button. This will resqtart it on the X-Valueyou chose. Note that thier cordinates would be identical even if its does not seem so.</p>
